#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
#   tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
#   smartthings, or mqtt.
#   This parameter must be provided.
off_when_shutdown: False
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
#off_when_shutdown_delay: 0
#   If "off_when_shutdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
#   (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.
on_when_job_queued: True
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: False
#   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
#   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
#   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.
#restart_delay: 1.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
#bound_service:
#   Can be set to any service Moonraker is authorized to manage with the
#   exception of the moonraker service itself. See the tip below this section
#   for details on what services are authorized.  When a bound service has
#   been set the service will be started when the device powers on and stopped
#   when the device powers off.  The default is no service is bound to the
#   device.
